Did you ever wonder what you gonna do with a Chef after reaching level 8 in cooking?
Did you also wonder where you gonna use these berries in the late game?

Now I can provide the answer. This mod simply adds different star meals that consists of berries, meat-type, veggie-type and many more ingredients. 
You can produce them at both, the fueled stove and electrical stove. The mood buffs above lavish meal and all star meals cancel each other out.
When a two or three-star meal is consumed or destroyed the contained plate will drop.
Also meant to provide a even better Gastronomy experience.
